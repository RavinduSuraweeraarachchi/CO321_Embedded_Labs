/*
    Write a function called EEPROMwrite() that takes the EEPROM address and the
    data as arguments and write to the EEPROM. 
    
    Write a function called EEPROMread() that takes the EEPROM address as an argument 
    and returns the data in that memory location. 
    
    (You donâ€™t need to show this part to the instructors but 
    you need to use these functions for the next questions).

/*
    WRITING TO EEPROM

    The following procedure should be followed to write data to the EEPROM:
        1. Wait until a previous EEPROM write operation is complete.
            * i.e. till EEPE bit becomes 0
        2. Write the new EEPROM address
            * EEARL and EEARH registers are used for this purpose
        3. Write the new data to be written in the EEPROM at the address
            * EEDR register is used for this purpose
        4. Write a logic 1 to the EEMPE bit WHILE writing logic 0 to EEPE
        5. Within FOUR CLOCK cycles, write a logic 1 to EEPE

*/

// i.e. EEPROM write function takes two arguments:
//      1. address: EEPROM address to write to
//      2. data: data to be written to the EEPROM
// There is no return value for this function

void EEPROMwrite(unsigned int address, char data)
{
    // Wait until the EEPROM is ready for a new write operation
    while (EECR & (1 << EEPE));

    // Set the EEPROM address
    EEARL = address;
    EEARH = address >> 8;

    // Set the data to be written
    EEDR = data;

    // Writing logic 1 to EEMPE while EEPE is 0
    EECR |= (1 << EEMPE);

    // Within four clock cycles, write logic 1 to EEPE to start the write operation
    // We can start immediately after setting EEMPE
    EECR |= (1 << EEPE);
}


// Function to read data from EEPROM

/*
    READING FROM EEPROM

    The following procedure should be followed to read data from the EEPROM:
        1. Wait until a previous EEPROM write operation is complete.
            * i.e. till EEPE bit becomes 0
        2. Write the new EEPROM address
            * EEARL and EEARH registers are used for this purpose
        3. Write a logic 1 to EERE bit to start the read operation
        4. Read the data from the EEDR register

//      1. address: EEPROM address to read from
